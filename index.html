    <p>
      This is a three.js scene that uses of glTF 3D models. The models are the same except that the blue one was preanimated and the pink one was also animated in three.js.
			<br>
      <br>

			The preanimated model (blue) was animated in Blender with its flapping wings and exported with the animation data. The static model's wings (pink) was also animated in blender, but the scale changing over time was done in three.js.
			<br>
      <br>

      <b>*Because the wings are thin, you may need to rotate the view to see them</b>
      <br>
      <br>

      This example also makes use of the three.js FontLoader to add text in the space (i.e. "Animated via JS" and "Animated via Blender").
